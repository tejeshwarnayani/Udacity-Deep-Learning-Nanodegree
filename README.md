# Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight initialization and batch normalization.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by real people (Udacity reviewers), but the starting code is available here, as well.

### Projects

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-bikesharing): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
